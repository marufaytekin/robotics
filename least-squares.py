# # Least Squares
# 
# In this notebook you'll use least squares to estimate a state vector $x$, given $m$ noisy measurements derived from:
# 
# $
# \tilde{y} = Hx + v
# $
# 
# $v$ is sampled from gaussian $N(0, R)$, and $H$ is a matrix mapping the state space to the measurement space. We'll assume x is constant, meaning the vehicle is currently not moving.
# 
# Thus you'll want to select an estimate of the state $x$, $\hat{x}$ which maximizes the likelihood of the observed measurements $\tilde{y}$:
# 
# $
# p(y = \tilde{y} | x = \hat{x})
# $

# ### Setup


# number of samples
# the larger this value the more
# accurate the x hat will be.
n_samples = 100

# size of state
n = 4


def make_H(m, degree, t):
    """
    Creates a matrix where
    each row is of the form:
    
        [t**degree, t**(degree-1), ..., 1]
    """
    H = np.zeros((m, degree))
    for i in np.arange(degree - 1, -1, -1):
        H[:, -i - 1] = t ** i
    return H


# known constants
t = np.random.uniform(-5, 5, n_samples)
H = make_H(n_samples, n, t)

# state, unknown in practice
x = np.random.randn(n) * 2

# ### Collecting Observations
# 
# First you'll have to collect $m$ noisy observations, these will be used later to estimate $x$.
# 
# **NOTE: You may have not encountered the `@` syntax. In a nutshell, `np.dot(H, x)` is equivalent to `H @ x`. If the equation contains multiple matrix multiplications, using `@` provides a much more comprehensible expression. **


# TODO: collect m noisy observations, the noise distribution should be gaussian
y_obs = H @ x + np.random.normal(0, 1, size=(n_samples))

plt.plot(t, y_obs, 'bx')
plt.title("Noisy Observations")

# The observations plot produces a polynomial of order `len(x) - 1`, i.e. a 4-element state produces a 3rd order polynomial. In this case the state $x$ are the coefficients of the polynomial. By generating observation from evaluating the polynomial at several different points we can gain a good approximation of the original state.
# 
# As one might imagine, recovering a good approximation of the state requires more samples as the order of the polynomial increases.

# ### Estimating $x$ 
# 
# Given enough samples $\hat{x}$ should converge to $x$. The exact number of measurements required depends on the complexity of mapping the state space to the measurement space, $H$ and how noisy the measurements are, determined by $v$.
# 
# Recall from lecture:
# 
# $
# \hat{x} = (H^T H)^{-1} H^T \tilde{y}
# $
# 
# $\hat{x}$ should be similar to $x$.


## TODO: calculate x_hat
HT = np.transpose(H)
x_hat = LA.pinv(HT @ H) @ HT @ y_obs
