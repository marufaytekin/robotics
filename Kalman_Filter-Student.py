# For simplicity, the drone can only move in the vertical direction, and the state is the vertical position and velocity,
# 
# $$
# x = \begin{bmatrix} \dot{z} \\ z \end{bmatrix}
# $$
# 
# The control input for the drone is the vertical acceleration $u = [\ddot{z}]$. 
# 
# The drone also has uncertainty associated with it's measurements (covariance matrix Q) and state predictions (covariance matrix R), which arise from the accuracy of the sensor and the drone's ability to precisely execute a given command.
# 
# The transition function has the following form:
# 
# $$
# g(x_t,u_t,\Delta t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ \Delta t & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \dot{z}\\z \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} \Delta t \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \ddot{z} \end{bmatrix}  = A_t x_t+B_tu_t
# $$
# 
# The partial derivative of $g$ with respect to x is:
# 
# $$
# g'(x_t,u_t,\Delta t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ \Delta t & 1   \end{bmatrix}
# $$

# ### KF + PID
# 
# In this section, we will once again ask our drone to hover at a constant height of -1m, but this time we will use a Kalman Filter to estimate the drone's altitude, instead of averaging as we had done previously.

# In[29]:

from PIDcontroller import PIDController_with_ff
from PathGeneration import flight_path


# First, we will generate a flight path, which will be a constant height of -1m. 

# In[30]:


total_time = 10.0  # Total flight time
dt = 0.01          # Time intervale between measurements 

t, z_path, z_dot_path, z_dot_dot_path =  flight_path(total_time, dt,'constant' )


# ###  Sensing
# 
# To generate the measurement data, we will simulate a range-finding sensor by adding noise to the actual altitude measurements.

# In[31]:

    def __init__(self):
        pass
